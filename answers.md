- **2) W = W(n-1) + W(n-2) + O(1), base cases: W(0), W(1) = O(1), the recurrance solves to O(n^2) due to the 2 recursive calls**

- **3) S(n) = S(n-1) + O(1), which solves to S(n) = O(n)**

- **4) The values in counts resemble the Fibonacci sequence, although not perfectly, in reverse.**

- **6) The most that fib_top_down(i) will be called for any value i is once, due to the use of memoization. The work and span are both O(n)**

- **8) The most that f_i will be read for any value i is twice, with work and span both being O(n)**
